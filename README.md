Solutions for the Advent Of Code 2023

## Inputs
All inputs that were given to me are still in the corresponding folders as `input.txt`.

## Organization
I will try to do each day in a different language, most of them I will be trying for the first time.

There will be one folder for each day, with the format:

`XX-Y`

, with `XX` the day with a leading zero if needed, and `Y` the language used.

## Used languages 

| Day | Title | Language |
| --- | ----- | -------- |
| 01  | Trebuchet!? | **COBOL** |
| 02  | Cube Conundrum | **Rust** |
| 03  | Gear Ratios | **python** |
| 04  | Scratchcards | **RockStar** |
